# FOOTBALL TRANSFERS APP

Welcome to the TransferApp, where a user"manager" can see and vet players available for transfer either on loan or for sale.
This project was inspired by the current football transfer trends in the January transfer window. 



## Instructions

For this project, youâ€™ll be building out a React application that displays a
list of available players for transfer, among other features.


## Setup

After unbundling the project:

1. Run `npm install` in your terminal.
2. Run `npm run server`. This will run your backend on port `3000`.
3. In a new terminal, run `npm start`. This will run your React app on port `3000`.

Make sure to open
[http://localhost:3000/players](http://localhost:3000/players) in the
browser to verify that your backend is working before you proceed!

The app uses [Bootstrap](https://bootstrap-ui.com/) for styling. If you see any
unfamiliar classNames on some components, don't sweat! That's coming from
Bootstrap UI and you shouldn't need to touch it.


## Endpoints

The base URL for your backend is: `http://localhost:3000`

## Core Deliverables

As a user/manager, I should be able to:

- See a list of the available players.
- Fill out and submit the form to add a new player for transfer. This should add the new
  player to the list **as well as post the new player to the backend
  API for persistence**.
- Filter players by typing into the search bar. Only players with a
  description matching the search term should be shown in the players list.

### Endpoints for Core Deliverables

#### GET /players

#### POST `/players`
